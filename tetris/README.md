#Tetris 

Project Overview
This folder contains a fully functional Tetris game for the Linux terminal. The game is part of the game-room repository, aiming to provide fun and educational terminal-based games. Written in C, this version of Tetris replicates the classic gameplay in a lightweight, terminal environment.

Game Description
Tetris is a famous puzzle game where differently shaped pieces (Tetrominoes) fall from the top of the screen. The goal is to move and rotate the pieces to create complete horizontal lines, which then disappear to earn points. If the stack of pieces reaches the top, the game ends.

Controls
'q', 'd': Move the piece left and right

'z', 's': Rotate the piece (change orientation)

'space': Accelerate the piece’s descent

Features
Real-time piece movement and rotation

Responsive controls

Clear terminal-based interface

Robust gameplay mechanics

How to Run
Compile the source files using a C compiler (e.g. gcc), then execute the game in your terminal.
